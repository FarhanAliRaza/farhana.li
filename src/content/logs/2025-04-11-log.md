Imagine this: you are vibecoding, everything is working, you are cruising your project, getting things done.

You encounter a bug. Oh, a simple bug. Here comes my SONNET Monster to kill that bug.
And it is promising, model replies in its very hopeful and charming way 

> Ah, I see the problem. I am gonna do this and that to fix your life.

Yes, it made the changes, but you rechecked, but the code is still not working. You tell it again that it is not fixed, and again, it Â replies in its charming way 

> Ah, I see the problem now. I am gonna do this and that to fix your life now.

But still, the bug is there, and it was not fixed as the first time.
You try many times, and nothing is working. You grow hopeless and start to think your father was right, you should have become a doctor. Oh, God, I should have studied more for that stupid MDCAT ðŸ¥².

Alas, but what can done now? You are stuck here with this stupid AI. Now, the amount of code is so big that if you start
Investigating it yourself will take a lot of time.

But I have a solution for you. 

## Write Tests

The basic solution is to write tests. They work great if you are working with backend code and the stupid model does not 
skip the failing test (Actually happened with me ðŸ˜‚). Give ai the test command to run the test. After that, models 
are smarter, and now they will figure things out.

## Promts to Rescue

Some methods that worked for me. 

- First, define the problem, then ask it to think deeply about and read the code. Then, think of 10 different ways that might be causing the problem and add pros and cons for each method.
- Ask it to add console logs to investigate what problem is causing the issue. Then, in the next message, pass the logs with the message
- Hopefully, after going through these steps models, you both get an understanding of the problem, and both of you solve the problem ðŸŽ‰
